# Create a function called capitalize that takes a string as an input
# The input string will be a sequence of words separated by spaces
# The function should return the input string with the first letter of each word capitalized
# For example, capitalize("hello world") should return "Hello World"
# If the first letter of a word is already capitalized, the function should leave that word unchanged
# Run python3 -m unittest test_functions.py in your terminal to check your work.
