# Create a function called game. It should take one argument, which is the number
# the number the user is trying to guess. 
# The function should prompt a user to guess a number repeatedly until they guess the correct number.
# If the user's guess is too high, the program should print "Too High!"
# If the user's guess is too low, the program should print "Too Low!"
# If the user's guess is invalid--for instance, they guess 'bob', the program should print "Invalid Input!"
# If the user's guess is correct, the program should print "You Win!" and stop the game.
# Run python3 -m unittest test_game.py to check your work.
